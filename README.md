### [Squid Game: Glass Bridge Challenge Browser Game](https://davidpnowak.com/p/squid-game-glass-bridge-challenge/)

_A fun little web browser game that lets you play the glass bridge challenge from Squid Game. Can you make it to the finish platform before time runs out?_

#### Project Guidelines

My aim for this project was to recreate the Glass Bridge Challenge from Squid Game in as little time as possible. I wanted to turn that challenge into a fun, little web browser game. I came up with the full design, which was based on MrBeast's Squid Game recreation, myself. 

Note: Good coding practices were not always followed in this project as I went for speed... and not coding perfection!

#### Project Approach

I decided to keep the code very basic and simple. I didn't want to get caught up in best practices or over engineering this small game. I wanted to get a good working version shipped in as short amount of time as possible.

I started by getting some inspiration from MrBeast's Squid Game YouTube video and made some hand drawn pencil sketches in a notebook. Afterwards, I coded up the UI/CSS of the desktop version first. Once that was complete, I started implementing the JavaScript code logic to make the game work and needed to refactor the data structure a couple times to make my life a bit easier. At the end I made sure that the game was fully responsive by adjusting the CSS for both tablet and mobile devices.
